# Railway Deployment Guide

## Overview

Railway is a modern deployment platform that makes it easy to deploy applications with minimal configuration. This guide covers everything you need to know about deploying your apps on Railway.

## Getting Started with Railway

### 1. Account Setup

- Sign up at railway.app using your GitHub account
- Connect your repositories for seamless deployments
- No credit card required to get started

### 2. First Deployment

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Deploy your project
railway up
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Railway makes it easy to manage environment variables:

- Add them through the web dashboard
- Use the CLI: `railway variables set KEY=value`
- Import from .env files
- Share variables between services

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Service Projects

Railway excels at multi-service applications:

- Frontend + Backend + Database in one project
- Automatic service discovery
- Shared environment variables
- Integrated monitoring

### Database Integration

Railway provides managed databases:

- PostgreSQL with extensions like pgvector
- MySQL, Redis, and MongoDB
- Automatic backups and scaling
- Connection string management

### Custom Domains

Setting up custom domains is straightforward:

1. Add your domain in the Railway dashboard
2. Update your DNS records
3. Railway automatically provisions SSL certificates
4. Support for wildcard domains and subdomains

## Best Practices

### Docker Optimization

```dockerfile
# Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
FROM node:24-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

FROM node:24-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Health Checks

Implement health check endpoints:

```javascript
app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: "healthy",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
});
```

### Monitoring and Logs

- Use Railway's built-in logging
- Set up alerts for critical issues
- Monitor resource usage
- Use structured logging (JSON format)

### Scaling Considerations

- Railway automatically scales based on traffic
- Configure resource limits appropriately
- Use horizontal scaling for high-traffic apps
- Consider database connection pooling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures**

- Check your Dockerfile syntax
- Verify all dependencies are listed
- Ensure proper file permissions
- Review build logs for specific errors

**Connection Issues**

- Verify service URLs and ports
- Check firewall and security group settings
- Ensure proper environment variable configuration
- Test locally before deploying

**Performance Problems**

- Monitor resource usage in Railway dashboard
- Optimize database queries
- Use caching strategies
- Consider CDN for static assets

### Debugging Tips

1. Use Railway's real-time logs
2. Deploy to staging environment first
3. Test with production-like data
4. Use feature flags for gradual rollouts

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

- Never commit sensitive data to Git
- Use Railway's secure variable storage
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments

### Network Security

- Railway provides HTTPS by default
- Use private networking between services
- Implement proper authentication
- Regular security updates

### Database Security

- Use connection string environment variables
- Enable SSL connections
- Regular database backups
- Principle of least privilege for database users

## Cost Optimization

### Resource Management

- Right-size your services
- Use sleep mode for development environments
- Monitor usage through Railway dashboard
- Scale down non-production environments

### Efficient Builds

- Use Docker layer caching
- Minimize image sizes
- Use efficient base images
- Remove unnecessary files

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Deploy to Railway
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "24"
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      - uses: railway/github-action@v1
        with:
          railway_token: ${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN }}
```

### Automated Testing
