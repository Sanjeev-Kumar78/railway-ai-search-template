# Railway Cohere Docs Search - Getting Started

Welcome to your AI-powered document search system! This guide will help you get started quickly.

## What is this?

This is a semantic search engine that understands the meaning of your queries, not just keywords. It's powered by Cohere's AI and deployed on Railway.

## Quick Start

1. **Add your documents**: Place `.txt`, `.md`, or other text files in the `docs/` folder
2. **Run the ingestion**: The worker will process your documents and create embeddings
3. **Start searching**: Use the web interface to search through your documents

## How it works

1. **Document Processing**: Your documents are split into manageable chunks
2. **AI Embeddings**: Each chunk gets converted to a vector representation using Cohere
3. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector for fast search
4. **Semantic Search**: When you search, we find the most similar content by meaning

## Example Documents

Here are some example documents to help you understand how the system works:

### API Documentation

````markdown
# Authentication API

To authenticate with our API, you need to include your API key in the header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.example.com/data
```

The API supports both JWT tokens and API keys for authentication.

The system will find relevant content even if you don't use the exact words from the documents!

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Use natural language**: Ask questions like you would to a human
2. **Be specific**: "How to deploy on Railway" is better than just "deploy"
3. **Try variations**: If you don't find what you need, rephrase your query
4. **Check similarity scores**: Higher percentages mean more relevant results
